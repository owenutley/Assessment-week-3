How does the internet work?

From my understanding the internet is essentially just a universal set of links between computers, allowing the passing and sharing of information.
The these links are what connects a computer to a router which will connect to other routers and data storages allowing a user to access information that isn't saved to their own hard drive.
When you use a browser it goes through a process to access the information you are searching for.
As an example, if you are to search for a website you need an IP adress. 



What happens when you click on a link?

When you click on a link, it directs you to a new page. 
It does this by changing the subdirectory, which you can see after the domain of a page in a search bar.
or if you aren't being linked to another place in the same domain, it can change the domain by finding the IP adress of the site that is linked.
To get the IP adress it checks your cache, router and so on until potentially checking DNS servers for it.
Overall it just links you to a set of programs that are running in a server that you access remotely.
